* Exercise 05 - Advanced deployment: Provision with Vagrant and Configure with Ansible
  - Description :: Provision a Virtual Machine using Vagrant as you did in previous exercises. This time the provisioner in not of type =shell= but of type =Ansible=, so first look at the =Vagrantfile= and then at the =provision.yml= file and try to understand what is going on this time.

    Provision the VM using this new system multiple times, check the VM and inspect virtualbox VMs using CLI.

* Solutions and Instructions
Of course update the repository on your lab VM, if not already done
#+begin_src sh
  cd FCC_REPO_FOLDER
  git pull
#+end_src
** Provision
As asual provision with Vagrant and look at the output
#+begin_src sh
  cd e05
  vargant up
#+end_src

When finished provision again and look at the output
#+begin_src sh
vagrant provision
#+end_src

** Check the new virtual-machine
#+begin_src sh
vagrant ssh
#+end_src

** Modify the Ansible recipe and provision again
Using an editor of your choice add =mysql= at the list of packages to be installed in =provision.yml= and save

#+begin_example
