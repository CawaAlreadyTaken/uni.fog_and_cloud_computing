* Lab Virtual Machine
In order to simplify the creation of a portable environment on
different Operating System and different hardware we leverage tools
like:
- [[https://www.vagrantup.com/][https://www.vagrantup.com/]]
- [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][https://www.virtualbox.org/]]
- [[https://www.ansible.com/]]
- Others

The Lab exercises are prepared to run on the Course Lab Environment provided to
every enrolled student. You could try to run exercises on other systems (eg:
your laptop) but I cannot guarantee the full compatibility.

During first exercises you will learn howto create portable development
environments by yourself, then for the following exercises I may provide you
instructions or scripts to create base environments we will use on exercises.

As a general rule, if the exercise folder contains only the =README.org=, you
should just follow those instructions, while if it contains other files, then
you need to change inside the folder and follow the steps from there as they are
relative to the specific exercise.
